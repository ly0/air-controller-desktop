# Version Notes
air-controller solves the pain point of browser-based transfer from Android to macOS. However, since the original project author seems to have stopped updating it, and I urgently needed this functionality, I made a series of modifications, resulting in this version (0.5.0) along with the corresponding air-controller-mobile.

1) The mobile app is running, but the desktop app can’t find it
